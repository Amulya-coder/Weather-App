The Weather App is a real-time project developed using JavaScript, CSS, Express and Handlebars. This project is an interesting project for simply weather forecasting. The user can check the condition of the present-day climate probability and predict whether the day is a cloudy or sunny day. The user can write down the name of any city across the world in the app.  

## Get Started

1. **Clone or download this repository**. `git clone https://github.com/Amulya-coder/Weather-App.git`

2. **Create a package.json file for your application**.
   `npm init`

3. **Now install Express in the weather-app directory and save it in the dependencies list**.

    ```npm install express```
    
4. **After that install nodemon as globally** `npm install -g nodemon`

5.  **Handlebars Installation** 
    
    Install using npm
  ```
  npm install express-handlebars
 ``` 

## Setup

1. To start the server:
   ```
   cd Weather-App
   npm start
   ```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser. 
  
## Note

**Insert the API key** that you got from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org) in `public/js/main.js`

 
  ## Usage
  
  This view engine uses sensible defaults that leverage the "Express-way" of structuring an app's views. This makes it trivial to use in basic apps:
